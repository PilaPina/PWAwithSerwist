 * Cleans up incompatible precaches that were created by older versions of

 *
 * This should be safe to use as long as you don't include `substringToFind`
 * (defaulting to `-precache-`) in your non-precache cache names.
 *
 * @param currentPrecacheName The cache name currently in use for
 * precaching. This cache won't be deleted.
 * @param substringToFind Cache names which include this
 * substring will be deleted (excluding `currentPrecacheName`).
 * @returns A list of all the cache names that were deleted.
