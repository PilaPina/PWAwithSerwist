/**
 * Changes the singleton `Router` to a different instance. This is meant for when you do not
 * want to pass your own `Router` to every one of Serwist's `Router`-dependent functions and classes.
 * If this or `getSingletonRouter` has been called before, it removes the listeners of the
 * previous singleton `Router`. It also adds those of the new one, so you need not do that yourself.
 *
 * It is highly recommended that you call this before anything else, if you plan on doing so.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { Router, setSingletonRouter } from "serwist/legacy";
 *
 * const router = new Router();
 *
 * setSingletonRouter(router);
 *
 * router.registerRoute(
 *   new Route(
 *     /\/api\/.*\/*.json/,
 *     new NetworkOnly(),
 *     "POST",
 *   ),
 * );
 * ```
 * @param router
 * @returns The new singleton `Router`.
 * @deprecated
